This website is built using the Agency Jekyll Theme starter template, providing a clean, professional design for showcasing portfolios. It is hosted on GitHub Pages and easily customizable through the _config.yml file, allowing you to update content and settings. The theme is open-source and available under the MIT license, and you can support its development via PayPal. Check out my portfolio to explore my projects, technical skills, and journey as a Data Analyst and Scientist.
